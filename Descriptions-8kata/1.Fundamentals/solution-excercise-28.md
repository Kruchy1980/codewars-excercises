# Convert a string to an array

Write a function to split a string and convert it into an array of words. For example:

### Solution

function stringToArray(string){

### For this excercise is enough to use split(' ') methode which returns string as an array of substrings

### Attention we need to remember to use blank space in between the thicks inside the brackets because in other way it will split out string for separate letters and it is not recommended for this excercise.

    return string.split(' ');

}
