# Classic Hello World

The main mode is having a method named main inside a class and should return nothing but should print a line to the standard output with the message Hello World! i.e. print the line Hello World! to the console. For Java the main method should receive String array as parameters that can be specified when running from console with the command. In many traditional programming languages can be only one main for a whole application since it denotes the application entry point.

    Solution.main("parameter1","parameter2");

Hints:

Check your references
Think about the scope of your method
For prolog you can use write but there are better ways

### Solution

// Print "Hello World!" to the screen

##### It is simple excercise from OOP in javascript we have class so we can use the static method to display it on the screen

    class Solution{
    static main() {
    console.log('Hello World!');
    }

}
