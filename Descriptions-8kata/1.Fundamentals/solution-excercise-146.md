Make a function that will return a greeting statement that uses an input; your program should return, "Hello, <name> how are you doing today?".

_[Make sure you type the exact thing I wrote or the program may not execute properly]_

##### It is easy to use here template strings only

    //your code here
    return `Hello, ${name} how are you doing today?`;

}
