# Swap Values

I would like to be able to pass an array with two elements to my swapValues function to swap the values. However it appears that the values aren't changing.

Can you figure out what's wrong here?

### Solution

function swapValues(arr) {
### To swap Values in two element arrays we can use the reverse() methode of arrays whoch reverses the elements in an array.
    return arr.reverse();
    }
