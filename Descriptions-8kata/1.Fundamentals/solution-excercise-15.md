## 5 without numbers !!

Write a function that always returns 5

Sounds easy right? Just bear in mind that you can't use any of the following characters: 0123456789\*+-/

Good luck :)

## Solution as in another excercis3s this the only one way of resolve the problem

function unusualFive() {

# First create a 5 elements list whatever the elements are named the important thing is not to use pure numbers in this excercise

const list = ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']

# returt its length

return list.length
}
