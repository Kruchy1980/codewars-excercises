## Alan Partridge II - Apple Turnover

Your job is simple, if (x) squared is more than 1000, return 'It's hotter than the sun!!', else, return 'Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.'.

X will be either a number or a string. Both are valid.

Other katas in this series:

function apple(x) {
    // We could easily use here ternary operator  as in former task
    return (x ** 2) >= 1000 ? 'It\'s hotter than the sun!!' : 'Help yourself to a honeycomb Yorkie for the glovebox.'
}
